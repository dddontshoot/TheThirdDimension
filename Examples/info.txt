Here's a simple example.
The zip file is a Factorio save game, to load it you can just drop it into Factorio/save, then load it like a normal save game.
while in the game, typing
/export -all
should give you a file very similar to mybase.base
And the final step, running main.py should give you a file similar to mybase.blend.

Good luck :-)
